    "# Biography Text Ablation Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand why the LLM is able to predict race so effectively, we performed an ablation analysis by replacing salient keywords with generic terms (e.g. \"Ang Lee\" is replaced with \"NAME\", \"Venezuela\" is replaced with \"LOCATION\") and observing how model performance changes. We focus on `names` (was the model trained on these people, so it has background information from pre-training), `location` (does the model have priors about what races tend to be concentrated in what locations?), and `ethnicity` (does it recognize explicit race-related information in the bio).\n",
